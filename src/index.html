    <h1>Hello, I'm Gratch</h1>
    <img src="../img/gratch.jpg" alt="Picture of Gratch">
    <p>I am a 1.5 year old terrier mix. I was found as a stray on the mean streets of Fresno when I was just 4 months old.</p>
    <p>I was sent to a shelter in Portland, OR where my mommy, Kristen, adopted me. I am a happy-go-lucky guy with tons of energy. My mom is my favorite person in the whole world. I am obsessed with her. I'm a huge fan of tug-o-war. I'm not so great at fetch (I sometimes forget to bring the ball back with me after I chase it). My favorite place to be is snuggled up under a blankie with my mom. I am incredibly spoiled and get a lot of treats. My favorites are chicken jerky and DentaSticks</p>
    <p>I love to go to the dog park and play chase with all the other doggies. Here is a map of all the dog parks in my hometown:</p>
